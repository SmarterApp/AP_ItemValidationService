# --------------------------------------------------------
# These properties are the local development properties.
#
# Spring boot uses this file when the application is launched
# with the root of the project set as the working directory.
# These properties take precedence over the classpath
# application.yml.
#
# Using gradle from the commandline means the working
# directory is by default the project root.
#
# Using Intellij you need to setup your run config so the
# working directory is the project root.
